Modification Policy (only for Multi-day Charter Bus)
Changes to the itinerary including pick-up times and locations must be submitted to Busbound at least 14 days (including) prior to date of service. No change or modification of scheduled Charter Services shall be valid unless and until approved by Busbound. Changes will be arranged based on availability of Busbound’s drives and buses.
There is no change fee for your first itinerary change unless the requested changes affect the pickup or drop-off times, stops or distance traveled. All subsequent charges to your itinerary will incur a fee:
- All subsequent itinerary changes made less than 72 hours prior to date of service that do not affect times, stops or distance will incur change fee. Please consult the Customer Support for details.
Client must contact Busbound by email to make itinerary changes.
Any changes (1st or final) to Client’s itinerary that impact time, stops or distance may affect Client’s charter costs. We calculate the charter costs based on time and additional pick-ups or drop offs. The amount of Estimated Cost is subject to the fee quotation quoted by the Sales Rep of Busbound.
If Client modifies the type of vehicle of the Charter Services Bus that has been reserved for Client’s trip, please note that pricing may change based on vehicle type and availability.
Changes to travel dates made more than 14 days (including) prior to the date of service are subject to change fee and are subject to vehicle availability.
Changes to travel dates made less than 14 days prior to date of service are considered a cancellation (as defined above) and require rebooking by Client.
If Client cancels the new change of date of the original Charter Services reservation, cancellation fee is going to be based on the original date of service. The cost for the rebooked Charter Services may differ significantly.
Busbound reserves the right to charge different rates based on current market conditions.
